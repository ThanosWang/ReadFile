This is the first version automatically checking UFO models uploaded.

Developers should use model independent files provided by the repository and change gauge, __author__, __date__, __version__ in __init__.py; __author__, __date__ in function_library.py and write_param_card.py with their own information.

Developers can put UFOModel_self_test.py in the same folder of their model files to test the completeness of necessary model dependent files.

Developers should upload one model once.
