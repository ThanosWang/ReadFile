This is the first version automatically checking UFO models uploaded.

Developers should use model independent files provided by the repository and change gauge, author,date, version in --init--.py; author, date in 'function_library.py' and 'write_param_card.py' with their own information.

Developers can put UFOModel_self_test.py in the same folder of their model files to test the completeness of necessary model dependent files.

Developers should upload one model once.

Users can use ReadParticles.py to see particles contained in each model.
